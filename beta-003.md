# InsanityBot 2.0.0-beta.003

This roadmap includes all planned changes to be included in the third beta release.

## Suggestions

InsanityBot will - finally - support suggestions! Planned features involve anonymous voting using buttons, extended staff tools and a host of configurable options.

## Storage

For better Windows compatibility, InsanityBot will use a database for storage. Nothing should change for the end user.
